# RSTea

A card deck containing Research Software Techniques to provide a quick aid to researchers and junior/novice RSEs, whilst being a reference point for senior or experienced RSEs and researchers.

This project began during [Collaboarions Workshop 2024](https://www.software.ac.uk/workshop/collaborations-workshop-2024-cw24)

The project has met all judging criteria ü•≥

- Novelty, creativity, coolness and/or usefulness  ‚òëÔ∏è
  - Many researcher-coders find searching for learning materials to answer their specific question at the level they are interested in challenging.
  - Long-form advice such as Carpentrise trianing and Turing Way exist but are hard to search for just one quick bit of info unless you know the terminology already.
  - RSTea provides a different way of interacting with the existing material to fit researchers busy schedules.
  - A physical deck of cards can be handed around and shared at coder coffee or RSE drop in sessions to spark conversation.
- Implementation and infrastructure ‚òëÔ∏è
  - We want to have a physical and digital platform for accessing these cards, allowing for wider use than just physical, and easier updating.
  - We are building hte tool to be extensible, using common file formats, tags and filtering to add extra categories or custom views later.
- MUST be clear on how you‚Äôre building on existing work  ‚òëÔ∏è
  - We are explicitly designing this as a signpost to further resources, amplifying good quality open teaching materials rather than reinventing the wheel.
  - We are inspired by [Pip Decks](https://pipdecks.com) as a resource for selecting appropriate tools from many options. 
- Demo and presentation (5 minutes)  ‚òëÔ∏è
  - We have created a demo version of the project in `Reveal.js` to give a feel for the final product in the limited time.
  - The final product is built on `bit.dev` which allows for adapting new views based on metadata for future extensions.
  - Our data format is designed to work with both systems and has a template for easy editing by new contributors.
- Project transparency  ‚òëÔ∏è
  - We kept working notes in our Google Doc nad all code will be shared on GitHub
- Future Potential  ‚òëÔ∏è
  - This tool will be used in RSE consultations such as UCL ARC drop-in sessions and code coffee MeetUps
