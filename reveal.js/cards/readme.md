# Readme

### Showcase your software!

<!-- Summary of why you would use this technique -->

How will other people know how to use your software?  What do they need to do to install or run it?  What problems can it solve for them?  By creating a README.md they will know whether your software can help them, and how to get started.

## Readme
<!-- Steps to implement this technique -->

1. Imagine you were searching for some software to solve a problem you are wokring on.  What would you want to know about it?  What do you need to know to install it?  Things you might want to include are:
* A description of the problem
* How to install your software
* Links to how to install software it depends on (such as R or Python)
* Examples of how to run the software, and expected output.

2. This card works well with **GitHub** to make your software findable.

3. If you are using **Testing** with **Continuous integration** you could add flags to your readme to show that your tests are running.
