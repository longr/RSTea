# API Design Basics

APIs are tools that help different parts of software talk to each other. Good API design is important for making software that's easy to use and understand.

## API Design Basics

1. **Keep It Simple**: Make APIs easy to understand and use by keeping them simple and focused.
2. **Use Clear Names**: Give endpoints easy-to-understand names so developers know what they do.
3. **Be Flexible**: Design APIs so they can adapt to changes without causing problems for existing software.
4. **Stay Secure**: Make sure APIs are safe by using strong security measures to protect data.
5. **Provide Documentation**: Give clear instructions on how to use APIs so developers know what to do.
