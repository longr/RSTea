### Add a new card

To add a new card to the deck, copy the `card-template.md` file form the root of the repository and give it a name for your technique you want to describe and save it to the repo sitory root. 
On the front of the card give a brief description of the technique and why it is important.
On the back of the card add steps to use the technique and links to further resources.
In the header metadata add soem tags for which catefgory this technique falls under (can be multiple categories), and an estimate of difficulty level (or how long it will take to implement).

### Create a new view

Each card is tagged with a range of metadata. These can be used to filter the deck to only techniques relevant to your use case, or add a new range of cards for a more specific audience such as domain-specific tools.
